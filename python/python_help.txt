File containing references

* Useful functions
- repr - converts to a python expression

* Data Types:
- Strings , raw strings
- int 
 
Operations
Slicing, Indexing, Multiply, Add , check membership, delete
Eg. del list_name[3]

* Data structures - 6 builtin sequences
- List, tuples and strings are also sequences as the elements are numbered in sequence
- List - Can be modified
- Tuple - cannot modify like strings. There are no append, sort possible like list.

* Mappings 
- Dictionaries (dict)
- Assigning one dict to another just copies the reference, modifying the copied one will affect the original dict. Check the use of copy and deepcopy.
  copy - shallow copy of keys and values. if value is list then again reference is made. so any change/add/del to key will not affect the copied obj but if list is modified then it will be reflected in the copied object as well.
- iterkeys method to iterate over dictionary object

* Containers
One type data type within another. Eg list within a list.

Other useful titbits:
- * argument in an assignment. Carries all the elements passed to this function
- 'is' operator tests for identity and not for equality. 
- enumerate - useful in iterating
- there is 'else' for 'for' statement as well
